# Environmental-Game
Coded this game to learn more about python as well as contributing it to my school for CCA fair.

Initial mindset when building the game was to learn the fundamentals of python syntax and it's functions while i create something that i can contribute back to my school.

Prototyped in python2.7 and ported over to 3.8.

might be buggy as i was too lazy to delete useless lines of codesðŸ¤ª

I will be happy to get any feedback for improvements or any updates you guys might like to add-oin to it!!
